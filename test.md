## General testing:
As I did not have a lot of time and I was not really expert in Jasmine or any automating testing, I decided to do all the testing manually via the browser and Chrome Developer tools.
My strategy is very simple: as soon as I write a line of code, I open the page in my browser to test it, make sure it works until I am fully happy with what I see and how it functions. 

For each feature I was working on, I tried to preview it in Chrome Dev tools to understand quickly which HTML element, CSS styling or Bootstrap class would cause a certain effect and correct it as soon as possible. 
This also allowed me to fully comprehend the languages, to work by small tasks and push to GitHub only after I made the whole feature was working well.

Once I was quite happy with the design and the site responsiveness, I moved to Javascript and performed the same manual tests as above.

## Final and official testing:
  * [W3 MarkUp validation](https://validator.w3.org)
  * [W3 CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
  * [PEP8 Python Validator](http://pep8online.com)

I checked the validity of my code at different times and received few errors on HTML markup which I worked on correcting. I did not get any errors with my CSS.

Through my own testing and with views of others, I have fixed a lot of design flaws and numerous bugs in my Javascript and Python code. Thanks to that, I can present a website which looks professional and is valid.

## Testing in different browsers:
I used Google Chrome as my primary browser and constantly tested it on my mobile phone also using the same browser. 
I also tested the game on Safari via an iMac with a very big screen and an iPod touch with probably the smallest screen regularly and never found any specific issue.
