## User Stories

During the scope plane and while establishing the user stories for each page and making wireframes, the following features were decided.
This helped me to plan ahead and also to work through specific sprints to implement one feature at a time, answering one user story at a time...
### As a general user, I am expecting:
* 

### As a user aged between 6 and 10 years old, I am expecting:
* 

### As a parent of child user, I am expecting:
* 

### As a developer, I want:
*

## Wireframes

I used Balsamiq tool for the wireframes and attached them to the directory in assets. 
I spent a considerable amount of time doing wireframes in details as I had no clue of design before and wanted to have a clear idea of how the website looked like.

# Testing

## Final and official testing:
  * [W3 MarkUp validation](https://validator.w3.org)
  * [W3 CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

I checked the validity of my code at different times and received few errors on HTML markup which I worked on correcting. I did not get any errors with my CSS.


## General testing:
As I did not have a lot of time and I was not really expert in Jasmine or any automating testing, I decided to do all the testing manually via the browser and Chrome Developer tools.
My strategy is very simple: as soon as I write a line of code, I open the page in my browser to test it, make sure it works until I am fully happy with what I see and how it functions. 

For each feature I was working on, I tried to preview it in Chrome Dev tools to understand quickly which HTML element, CSS styling or Bootstrap class would cause a certain effect and correct it as soon as possible. 
This also allowed me to fully comprehend the languages, to work by small tasks and push to GitHub only after I made the whole feature was working well.

Once I was quite happy with the design and the site responsiveness, I moved to Javascript and performed the same manual tests as above. 


## Testing in different browsers:
I used Google Chrome as my primary browser and constantly tested it on my mobile phone also using the same browser. 
I also tested the game on Safari via an iMac with a very big screen and an iPod touch with probably the smallest screen regularly and never found any specific issue.

# Technologies Used
- [GitPod](gitpod.io) - I used __GitPod__ as my IDE for the development of this website.
- __HTML__ language is used to create the structure of the website and game.
- __CSS__ language is used to add styling on the structure of the website.
- [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) - The website is using __Bootstrap4__ as the basic structure and grid of the website and to increase the responsiveness of the website.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) - The website uses __jQuery__ and __Popper.js__ to bring in Javascript which makes the navbar responsive
- __Javascript__ functioning language is used to fetch external data and add interactivity on the website so the game functions based on user's actions
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - I used jQuery to avoid repeating same actions on the DOM when buttons were clicked
- [FontAwesome](https://kit.fontawesome.com/f7e192f540.js) - The website is using __Font Awesome__ to display the social media icons in my footer
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)- The website uses __1 Google font__- Url imported in CSS
- [AutoPrefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - I have used __AutoPrefixer__ to make sure the css code worked on all browsers
- [Tiny.jpg](https://tinyjpg.com) - I have used __Tinyjpg__ to compress logo image of the website to increase the website loading on browser
- [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space) - I have used __ColorSpace__ to find matching colors for the website
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud) - I have used __Balsamic__ to build the wireframes which I then exported to the IDE
- [Favicon converter](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) - I used Favicon converter to convert the logo into a favicon which I was able to insert in the asset folder and I tested it to be working
- [Sweetalert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/)
* [Unicorn Revealer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unicorn-revealer/lmlkphhdlngaicolpmaakfmhplagoaln?hl=en-GB)

# Deployment
I have been using the Integrated development environment (IDE) [GitPod](gitpod.io) to develop this milestone project.
As I used it for the first time and Code Institute changed the preferred IDE for the whole course, I was lucky to avail of the full template prepared by Code Institute at the time.

I went to Code Institute [full template repository](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template), cloned it and created my own repository with the template ready. From there, I opened GitPod which started a workspace.

From that point, I could add, commit any update of my code and push it to the remote repository so it could be regularly backed up and accessed by others.

## Enabling GitHub Pages to publish site from master as a publishing source

* Opened up GitHub in the browser.
* Signed in using username and password.
* Selected my repositories.
* Navigated to [FlagGame repository](https://github.com/mkuti/FlagGame_milestone_2).
* In the top navigation clicked 'settings'.
* Scrolled down to the GitHub Pages area.
* Selected 'Master Branch' from the 'Source' dropdown menu.
* Clicked to confirm my selection.
* Your site is published [https://mkuti.github.io/FlagGame_milestone_2/](https://mkuti.github.io/FlagGame_milestone_2/)

When I submitted this Milestone project, I confirmed that the Development Branch and Master Branch are identical.

## How to run code locally

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository
2. Under the repository name, click Clone or download
3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, click to copy the clone URL for the repository
4. Using favorite IDE, open Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the desired file location
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2 when git clone: [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORYâ€¨](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY)
7. Press Enter > Your local clone will be created.
